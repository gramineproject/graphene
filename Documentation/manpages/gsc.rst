:program:`gsc` -- Graphene Shielded Containers
==============================================

.. warning::
    GSC is still under development and must not be used in production! Please
    see `issue #1520 <https://github.com/oscarlab/graphene/issues/1520>`__ for a
    description of missing features and security caveats.

Synopsis
========

:command:`gsc` *COMMAND* [*OPTIONS*] ...

Description
===========

Docker containers are widely used to deploy applications in the cloud. Using
Graphene Shielded Containers (GSC) we provide the infrastructure to deploy Docker
containers protected by Intel SGX enclaves using the Graphene Library OS.

The :program:`gsc` tool transforms a Docker image into a new image
(called ``gsc-<image-name>``) which includes the Graphene Library OS, manifest
files, Intel SGX related information, and executes the application inside an
Intel SGX enclave using the Graphene Library OS. It follows the common Docker
approach to first build an image and subsequently run a container of an image.
At first a Docker image has to be graphenized via the :command:`gsc build`
command. When the graphenized image should run within an Intel SGX enclave, the
image has to be signed via a :command:`gsc sign-image` command. Subsequently,
the image can be run using :command:`docker run`.

Prerequisites
=============

The installation descriptions of prerequisites are for Ubuntu 18.04 and may
differ when using a different Ubuntu version or Linux distribution.

Software packages
-----------------

Please install the ``docker.io``, ``python3``, ``python3-pip`` packages. In
addition, install the Docker client, Jinja2, TOML, and YAML python packages via
pip. GSC requires Python 3.6 or later.

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo apt install docker.io python3 python3-pip
   pip3 install docker jinja2 toml pyyaml

SGX software stack
------------------

To run with Intel SGX, please install the corresponding software stack as
described in :doc:`../building`.

Host configuration
------------------

To create Docker images, the user must have access to Docker daemon.

.. warning::
    Please use this step with caution. By granting the user access to the Docker
    group, the user may acquire root privileges via :command:`docker run`.

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo adduser $USER docker

Create a configuration file called :file:`config.yaml` or specify a different
configuration file via :program:`gsc` option. Please see the documentation on
configuration options below and use the :file:`config.yaml.template` as
reference.

Command line arguments
======================

.. option:: --help

   Display usage.

.. program:: gsc-build

:command:`gsc build` -- build graphenized image
-----------------------------------------------

Builds an unsigned graphenized Docker image of an application image called
``gsc-<IMAGE-NAME>-unsigned`` by compiling Graphene or relying on a prebuilt
Graphene image.

:command:`gsc build` [*OPTIONS*] <*IMAGE-NAME*> <*APP.MANIFEST*>

.. option:: -d

   Compile Graphene with debug flags and debug output. If configured to use a
   prebuilt Graphene image, the image has to support this option.

   Allow untrusted arguments to be specified at :command:`docker run`. Otherwise
   any arguments specified during :command:`docker run` are ignored.

.. option:: --no-cache

   Disable Docker's caches during :command:`gsc build`. This builds the
   unsigned graphenized image from scratch.

.. option:: --rm

   Remove intermediate Docker images created by :command:`gsc build`, if the

------------------------------------------------------

Signs the enclave of an unsigned graphenized Docker image and creates a new
Docker image called ``gsc-<IMAGE-NAME>``. :command:`gsc sign-image` always
removes intermediate Docker images, if successful or not, to ensure the removal
of the signing key in them.

.. option:: IMAGE-NAME

   Name of the resulting Graphene Docker image

.. program:: gsc-info-image

:command:`gsc info-image` -- retrieve information about graphenized Docker image
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Retrieves Intel SGX relevant information about the graphenized Docker image such
as the ``MRENCLAVE`` and ``MRSIGNER`` measurements for each application in the
Docker image.

Synopsis:

:command:`gsc info-image` <*IMAGE-NAME*>

.. option:: IMAGE-NAME

   Name of the graphenized Docker image

Using Graphene's trusted command line arguments
-----------------------------------------------

Most executables aren't designed to run with attacker-controlled arguments.
Allowing an attacker to control executable arguments can break the security of
the resulting enclave.

:command:`gsc build` uses the existing Docker image's entrypoint and cmd fields
to identify the trusted arguments. These arguments are stored in
:file:`trusted_argv`. This file is only generated when :option:`--insecure-args
<gsc-build --insecure-args>` is *not* specified. As a result any arguments
specified during :command:`docker run` are ignored.

To be able to provide arguments at runtime, the image build has to enable this
via the option :option:`--insecure-args <gsc-build --insecure-args>`.

Stages of building graphenized SGX Docker images
------------------------------------------------

The build process of a graphenized Docker image from image ``<image-name>``
follows three main stages and produces an image named ``gsc-<image-name>``.
:command:`gsc build-graphene` performs only the first stage,
:command:`gsc build` performs the first two stages, and finally
:command:`gsc sign-image` performs the last stage.

#. **Building Graphene.** The first stage builds Graphene from sources based on
   the provided configuration (see :file:`config.yaml`) which includes the
   distribution (e.g., Ubuntu 18.04), Graphene repository, and the Intel SGX
   driver details. This stage can be skipped if :command:`gsc build` uses a
   pre-built Graphene Docker image.

#. **Graphenizing the application image.** The second stage copies the important
   Graphene artifacts (e.g., the runtime and signer tool) from the first stage
   (or if the first stage was skipped, it pulls a prebuilt Docker image defined
   via the configuration file).  It then prepares image-specific variables such
   as the executable path and the library path, and scans the entire image to
   generate a list of trusted files.  GSC excludes files and paths starting with
   :file:`/boot`, :file:`/dev`, :file:`/proc`, :file:`/var`, :file:`/sys` and
   :file:`/etc/rc`, since checksums are required which either don't exist or may
   vary across different deployment machines. GSC combines these variables and
   list of trusted files into a new manifest file. In a last step the entrypoint
   is changed to launch the :file:`apploader.sh` script which generates an Intel
   SGX token and starts the :program:`pal-Linux-SGX` loader. Note that the
   generated image (``gsc-<image-name>-unsigned``) cannot successfully load an
   Intel SGX enclave, since essential files and the signature of the enclave are
   still missing (see next stage).

#. **Signing the Intel SGX enclave.** The third stage uses Graphene's signer
   tool to generate SIGSTRUCT files for SGX enclave initialization. This tool
   also generates an SGX-specific manifest file.  The required signing key is
   provided by the user via the :command:`gsc sign-image` command and copied
   into this Docker build stage. The generated image is called
   ``gsc-<image-name>`` and includes all necessary files to start an Intel SGX
   enclave.

In the future we plan to provide prebuilt Graphene images for popular
cloud-provider offerings.

Generating a signed graphenized Docker image
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The last stage combines the graphenized Docker image with the signed enclave and
manifest files. Therefore it copies the SIGSTRUCT files and the SGX-specific
manifest file from the previous stage into the graphenized Docker image from the
second stage.

Configuration
=============

GSC is configured via a configuration file called :file:`config.yaml` or
specified as a :program:`gsc` option. A template configuration file is provided
in :file:`config.yaml.template`.

.. describe:: Distro

   Defines Linux distribution to be used to build Graphene in. Currently the
   only supported value is ``ubuntu18.04``.

.. describe:: Graphene.Repository

   Source repository of Graphene. Default value:
   `https://github.com/oscarlab/graphene.git
   <https://github.com/oscarlab/graphene.git>`__.

.. describe:: Graphene.Branch

   Use this branch of the repository. Default value: master.

.. describe:: Graphene.Image

   Builds graphenized Docker image based on a prebuilt Graphene Docker image.
   These images are prepared via :command:`gsc build-graphene` and will be
   provided for popular cloud-provider environments. `Graphene.Repository` and
   `Graphene.Branch` are ignored in case `Graphene.Image` is specified.

.. describe:: SGXDriver.Repository

   Source repository of the Intel SGX driver. Default value:
   `https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx-driver.git
   <https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx-driver.git>`__.

.. describe:: SGXDriver.Branch

   Use this branch of the repository. Default value: sgx_driver_1.9.

Run graphenized Docker images
=============================

Execute :command:`docker run` command via Docker CLI and provide gsgx and
isgx/sgx devices and the PSW/AESM socket. Additional Docker options and
executable arguments may be supplied to the :command:`docker run` command.

.. warning::
   Forwarding devices to a container lowers security of the host. GSC should
   never be used as a sandbox for applications (i.e. it only shields the app
   from the host but not vice versa).

.. program:: docker

:command:`docker run` [*OPTIONS*] gsc-<*IMAGE-NAME*> [<*ARGUMENTS*>]

.. option:: OPTIONS

   :command:`docker run` options. Common options include ``-it`` (interactive
   with terminal), ``-d`` (detached), ``--device`` (forward device). Please see
   `Docker manual <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/>`__
   for details.

.. option:: IMAGE-NAME

   Name of original image (without GSC build).

.. option:: ARGUMENTS

   Arguments to be supplied to the executable launching inside the Docker
   container and Graphene. Such arguments may only be provided when
   :option:`--insecure-args <gsc-build --insecure-args>` was specified during
   :command:`gsc build`.


Execute with Linux PAL instead of Linux-SGX PAL
-----------------------------------------------

When specifying :option:`-L <gsc-build -L>`  during GSC :command:`gsc build`,
you may select the Linux PAL at Docker run time instead of the Linux-SGX PAL by
specifying the environment variable :envvar:`GSC_PAL` as an option to the
:command:`docker run` command. When using the Linux PAL, it is not necessary to
sign the image via a :command:`gsc sign-image` command.

.. envvar:: GSC_PAL

   This environment variable specifies the pal loader.

.. code-block:: sh

   docker run ... --env GSC_PAL=Linux gsc-<image-name> ...

Example
=======

The :file:`test` folder in :file:`Tools/gsc` describes how to graphenize Docker
images and test them with sample inputs. The samples include Ubuntu-based Docker
images of Bash, Python, Node.js, Numpy and Pytorch.

.. warning::
   All test images rely on insecure arguments to be able to set test-specific
   arguments to each application. These images are not intended for production
   environments.

The example below shows how to graphenize the public Docker image of Python3.
This example assumes that all prerequisites are installed and configured.

#. Create a configuration file:

   .. code-block:: sh

      cd Tools/gsc
      cp config.yaml.template config.yaml
      # Manually adopt config.yaml to the installed Intel SGX driver and desired
      # Graphene repository/version.

#. Generate the signing key (if you don't already have a key):

   .. code-block:: sh

      openssl genrsa -3 -out enclave-key.pem 3072

#. Pull public Python image from Dockerhub:

   .. code-block:: sh

      docker pull python

#. Graphenize the Python image using :command:`gsc build`:

   .. code-block:: sh

      ./gsc build --insecure-args python test/ubuntu18.04-python3.manifest

#. Sign the graphenized Docker image using :command:`gsc sign-image`:

   .. code-block:: sh

      ./gsc sign-image python enclave-key.pem

#. Retrieve SGX-related information from graphenized image using :command:`gsc info-image`:

   .. code-block:: sh

      ./gsc info-image gsc-python

#. Test the graphenized Docker image (change ``--device=/dev/isgx`` to your
   version of the Intel SGX driver if needed):

   .. code-block:: sh

      docker run --device=/dev/gsgx --device=/dev/isgx \
         -v /var/run/aesmd/aesm.socket:/var/run/aesmd/aesm.socket \
         gsc-python -c 'print("HelloWorld!")'

#. You can also start a Bash interactive session in the graphenized Docker
   image (useful for debugging):

   .. code-block:: sh

      docker run --device=/dev/gsgx --device=/dev/isgx \
         -v /var/run/aesmd/aesm.socket:/var/run/aesmd/aesm.socket \
         -it --entrypoint /bin/bash gsc-python

Limitations
===========

This document focuses on the most important limitations of GSC.
`Issue #1520 <https://github.com/oscarlab/graphene/issues/1520>`__ provides the
complete list of known limitations and serves as a discussion board for
workarounds.

Dependency on Ubuntu 18.04
--------------------------

Docker images not based on Ubuntu 18.04 may not be compatible with GSC. GSC
relies on Graphene to execute Linux applications inside Intel SGX enclaves and
the installation of prerequisites depends on package manager and package
repositories. GSC can simply be extended to support other distributions by
providing a template for this distribution in :file:`Tools/gsc/templates`.

Trusted data in Docker volumes
------------------------------

Data mounted as Docker volumes at runtime is not included in the general search
for trusted files during the image build. As a result, Graphene denies access to
these files, since they are neither allowed nor trusted files. This will likely
break applications using files stored in Docker volumes.

Workaround
^^^^^^^^^^

   Trusted files can be added to image-specific manifest file (first argument to
   :command:`gsc build` command) at build time. This workaround does not allow
   these files to change between build and run, or over multiple runs. This only
   provides integrity for files and not confidentiality.

Allowing dynamic file contents via Graphene protected files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Docker volumes can include Graphene protected files. As a result Graphene can
   open these protected files without knowing the exact contents as long as the
   protected file was configured in the manifest. The complete and secure use of
   protected files may require additional steps.

Integration of Docker Secrets
-----------------------------

Docker Secrets are automatically pulled by Docker and the results are stored
either in environment variables or mounted as files. GSC is currently unaware of
such files and hence, cannot mark them trusted. Similar to trusted data, these
files may be added to the manifest.

Access to files in excluded paths
---------------------------------

The manifest generation excludes all files and paths starting with
:file:`/boot`, :file:`/dev`, :file:`/proc`, :file:`/var`, :file:`/sys`, and
:file:`/etc/rc` from the list of trusted files. If your application
relies on some files in these directories, you must manually add them to the
manifest::

   sgx.trusted_files.[identifier] = "[URI]"
   or
   sgx.allowed_files.[identifier] = "[URI]"

Docker images with non-executables as entrypoint
------------------------------------------------

Docker images may contain a script entrypoint which is not an ELF executable.
:program:`gsc` fails to recognize such entrypoints and fails during the image
build. A workaround relies on creating an image from the application image which
has an entrypoint of the script interpreter with the script as an argument. This
allows :program:`gsc` to start the interpreter instead of the script.
