Introduction to Graphene
************************

What is Graphene Library OS?
============================

Graphene is a |~| lightweight guest OS, designed to run a |~| single Linux
application with minimal host requirements. Graphene can run applications in an
isolated environment with benefits comparable to running a |~| complete OS in a
|~| virtual machine -- including guest customization, ease of porting to
different host OSes, and process migration.

Graphene supports running Linux applications using the :term:`Intel SGX <SGX>`
(Software Guard Extensions) technology (we call this version **Graphene-SGX**).
With Intel SGX, applications are secured in hardware-encrypted memory regions
(called SGX enclaves). SGX protects code and data in the enclave against
privileged software attacks and against physical attacks on the hardware off the
CPU package (e.g., cold-boot attacks on RAM). Graphene is able to run unmodified
applications inside SGX enclaves, without the toll of manually porting the
application to the SGX environment.

What Hosts Does Graphene Currently Run On?
==========================================

Graphene was developed to encapsulate all host-specific code in one layer,
called the Platform Adaptation Layer, or :term:`PAL`. Thus, if there is a PAL
for a |~| given host, the library OS and applications will "just work".

Porting Graphene to a |~| new host only requires :doc:`porting PAL
<pal/porting>`, by implementing the :doc:`pal/host-abi` using OS features of the
host. To date, we ported Graphene to FreeBSD (this port is not maintained
anymore) and Linux (the latter also with Intel SGX support). Support for more
hosts is expected in the future.

How to Build and Run Graphene?
==============================

See :doc:`quickstart` for instructions how to quickly build and run Graphene.
For full build instructions, see :doc:`building`. To deploy Graphene in the
cloud, see :doc:`cloud-deployment`.

How to Contact the Maintainers?
===============================

For bug reports, post an issue on our GitHub repository:
https://github.com/oscarlab/graphene/issues.

For any questions, please send an email to support@graphene-project.io
(`public archive <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/graphene-support>`__).
