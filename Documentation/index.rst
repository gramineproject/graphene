Introduction to Graphene
************************

Graphene is a |~| lightweight guest OS, designed to run a |~| single Linux
application with minimal host requirements. Graphene can run applications in an
isolated environment with benefits comparable to running a |~| complete OS in a
|~| virtual machine -- including guest customization, ease of porting to
different host OSes, and process migration.

Graphene supports running Linux applications using the :term:`Intel SGX <SGX>`
(Software Guard Extensions) technology (we call this version **Graphene-SGX**).
With Intel SGX, applications are secured in hardware-encrypted memory regions
(called SGX enclaves). SGX protects code and data in the enclave against
privileged software attacks and against physical attacks on the hardware off the
CPU package (e.g., cold-boot attacks on RAM). Graphene is able to run unmodified
applications inside SGX enclaves, without the toll of manually porting the
application to the SGX environment.

Building and running Graphene
=============================

See :doc:`quickstart` for instructions how to quickly build and run Graphene.
For full build instructions, see :doc:`building`. To deploy Graphene in the
cloud, see :doc:`cloud-deployment`.
