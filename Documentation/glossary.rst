   PAL
      Platform Adaptation Layer

      PAL is the layer of Graphene that implements a narrow Drawbridge-like ABI
      interface (with function names starting with the `Dk` prefix)

      Whenever Graphene requires a service from the host platform (memory
      allocation, thread management and synchronization, file system and network
      stacks, etc.), it calls the corresponding PAL functionality. The PAL ABI
      is host-platform agnostic and is backed by the host-platform specific PAL,
      for example, the Linux-SGX PAL.

   RA-TLS
      A library to augment classic SSL/TLS sessions with
      :term:`Remote Attestation`. RA-TLS extends the SSL/TLS handshake protocol
      to force one endpoint into verifying the :term:`SGX Quote` embedded into
      the other endpoint's certificate chain. RA-TLS is designed to be a drop-in
      replacement for classic SSL/TLS libraries.

   Secret Provisioning
      Secret provisioning is a mechanism to deliver secrets (such as encryption
      keys, passwords, etc.) from a remote trusted party inside a :term:`TEE`.
      It is typically built on top of a :term:`Secure Channel`.

   Secure Channel
      Secure channels are communication channels for trusted transmission of
      arbitrary data between a :term:`TEE` and a remote trusted party or between
      two TEEs. They are typically built on top of the classic TLS/SSL channels.

         :doc:`attestation`

   SGX
      Software Guard Extensions is a set of instructions on Intel processors for
      creating Trusted Execution Environments (:term:`TEE`). See
      :doc:`/sgx-intro`.
