Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning in Intel SGX
###################################################

In this tutorial, we're going to walk you through an example of privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML).
We will show how you can use
`Intel SGX <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/software-guard-extensions.html>`_
and `Graphene <https://grapheneproject.io/>`_ to protect any private data
(e.g., models or inputs) in an  ML workload written in `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org>`_.
