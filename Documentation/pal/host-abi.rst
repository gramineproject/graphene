PAL Host ABI
============

What is Graphene's PAL Host ABI
-------------------------------

PAL Host ABI is the interface used by Graphene to interact with its host. It is translated into
the host's native ABI (e.g. system calls for UNIX) by a layer called the Platform Adaptation Layer
(PAL). A PAL not only exports a set of APIs (PAL APIs) that can be called by the library OS, but
also acts as the loader that bootstraps the library OS. The design of PAL Host ABI strictly follows
three primary principles, to guarantee functionality, security, and portability:

* The host ABI must be stateless.
* The host ABI must be a narrowed interface to reduce the attack surface.
* The host ABI must be generic and independent from the native ABI of any of the supported hosts.

Most of the PAL Host ABI is adapted from the Drawbridge library OS.

PAL as Loader
-------------

Regardless of the actual implementation, we require PAL to be able to load ELF-format binaries
as executables or dynamic libraries, and perform the necessary dynamic relocation. PAL needs
to look up all unresolved symbols in loaded binaries and resolve the ones matching the names of
PAL APIs. PAL does not and will not resolve other unresolved symbols, so the loaded libraries and
executables must resolve them afterwards.

After loading the binaries, PAL needs to load and interpret the manifest files. The manifest syntax
is described in :doc:`../manifest-syntax`.

Manifest and Executable Loading Rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The PAL loader supports multiple ways of locating the manifest and executable. To run a program
in Graphene properly, the PAL loader generally requires both a manifest and an executable,
although it is possible to load with only one of them. The user shall specify either the manifest
or the executable to load in the command line, and the PAL loader will try to locate the other
based on the file name or content.

Precisely, the loading rules for the manifest and executable are as follows:

#. The first argument given to the PAL loader (e.g., `pal-Linux`,
   `pal-Linux-SGX`, or the cross-platform wrapper, `pal-loader`) can be either
   a manifest file or an executable.
#. If an executable is given to the command line, the loader will search for the
   manifest in the following order: the same file name as the executable with
   a `.manifest` or `.manifest.sgx` extension, a `manifest` file without any
   extension, or no manifest at all.
#. If a manifest is given to the command line, and the manifest contains
   a `loader.exec` rule, then the rule is used to determine the executable. The
   loader should exit if the executable file doesn't exist.
#. If a manifest is given to the command line, and the manifest does *not*
   contain a `loader.exec rule`, then the manifest *may* be used to infer the
   executable. The potential executable file has the same file name as the
   manifest file except it doesn't have the `.manifest` or `.manifest.sgx`
   extension.
#. If a manifest is given to the command line, and no executable file can be
   found either based on any `loader.exec` rule or inferring from the manifest
   file, then no executable is used for the execution.


Data Types and Variables
------------------------

Data Types
^^^^^^^^^^

PAL handles
"""""""""""

The PAL handles are identifiers that are returned by PAL when opening or
creating resources. The basic data structure of a PAL handle is defined as
follows::

   typedef union pal_handle {
       struct {
           PAL_IDX type;
       } hdr;
       /* other resource-specific definitions */
   }* PAL_HANDLE;

.. doxygenunion:: pal_handle
   :project: pal
.. doxygentypedef:: PAL_HANDLE
   :project: pal

As shown above, a PAL handle is usually defined as a `union` data type that
contains different subtypes that represent each resource such as files,
directories, pipes or sockets. The actual memory allocated for the PAL handles
may be variable-sized.

Graphene Control Block
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The control block in Graphene is a structure that provides static information
about the current process and its host. It is also a dynamic symbol that will be
linked by the library OS and resolved at runtime. Sometimes, for the flexibility
or the convenience of the dynamic resolution, the address of the control block
may be resolved by a function (:func:`pal_control_addr()`).

The fields of the Graphene control block are defined as follows:

.. doxygentypedef:: PAL_CONTROL
   :project: pal
.. doxygenstruct:: PAL_CONTROL_

Pal APIs
--------

The PAL APIs contain a |~| number of functions that can be called from the
library OS.


Memory Allocation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ABI includes three calls to allocate, free, and modify the permission bits
on page-base virtual memory. Permissions include read, write, execute, and
guard. Memory regions can be unallocated, reserved, or backed by committed
memory.

.. doxygenfunction:: DkVirtualMemoryAlloc
   :project: pal

.. doxygenfunction:: DkVirtualMemoryFree
   :project: pal

.. doxygenenum:: PAL_ALLOC
   :project: pal
.. doxygenenum:: PAL_PROT
   :project: pal

.. doxygenfunction:: DkVirtualMemoryProtect
   :project: pal


Process Creation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ABI includes one call to create a child process and one call to terminate
the running process. A child process does not inherit any objects or memory from
its parent process and the parent process may not modify the execution of its
children. A parent can wait for a child to exit using its handle. Parent and
child may communicate through I/O streams provided by the parent to the child at
creation.

.. doxygenfunction:: DkProcessCreate
   :project: pal
.. doxygenfunction:: DkProcessExit
   :project: pal


Stream Creation/Connection/Open
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The stream ABI includes nine calls to open, read, write, map, unmap,
truncate, flush, delete and wait for I/O streams and three calls to
access metadata about an I/O stream. The ABI purposefully does not
provide an ioctl call. Supported URI schemes include:
``file:``,
``pipe:``,
``http:``,
``https:``,
``tcp:``,
``udp:``,
``pipe.srv:``,
``http.srv``,
``tcp.srv:`` and
``udp.srv:``.
The latter four schemes are used to open inbound I/O streams for server
applications.

Thread Creation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ABI supports multithreading through five calls to create, sleep, yield the
scheduler quantum for, resume execution of, and terminate threads, as well as
seven calls to create, signal, and block on synchronization objects.

Miscellaneous

cryptographically-strong random bits, flush portions of instruction caches,
increment and decrement the reference counts on objects shared between threads,
and to obtain an attestation report and quote.
