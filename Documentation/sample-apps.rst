Running Sample Applications
===========================

.. highlight:: sh

We prepared and tested several applications to demonstrate Graphene and
Graphene-SGX usability. These applications can be found in the :file:`Examples`
folder in the repository, each containing a short README with instructions how
to test it. We recommend starting with simpler, thoroughly documented examples
like Memcached and Redis, to understand manifest options and features of
Graphene.
