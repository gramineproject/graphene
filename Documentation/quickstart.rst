Quick start
===========

.. highlight:: sh

Quick start without SGX support
-------------------------------

#. Clone the Graphene repository::

      git clone https://github.com/oscarlab/graphene.git

#. Build Graphene::

      sudo apt-get install -y build-essential autoconf gawk bison wget python3
      cd graphene
      make
      meson build -Ddirect=enabled -Dsgx=disabled
      ninja -C build
      sudo ninja -C build install

#. Build and run :program:`helloworld`::

      cd LibOS/shim/test/regression
      make
      graphene-direct helloworld

#. For more complex examples, see :file:`Examples` directory.

Quick start with SGX support
-------------------------------

Graphene requires several features from your system:

- the FSGSBASE feature of recent processors must be enabled in the Linux kernel,
- the Intel SGX driver must be built in the Linux kernel,
- Intel SGX SDK/PSW and (optionally) Intel DCAP must be installed.

If your system doesn't meet these requirements, please refer to more detailed
descriptions in :doc:`building`.

#. Ensure that Intel SGX is enabled on your platform::

      lsmod | grep sgx
      ps ax | grep [a]esm_service

The first command should list :command:`isgx` (or :command:`sgx`) and the
second command should list the process status of :command:`aesm_service`.

#. Clone the Graphene repository::

      git clone https://github.com/oscarlab/graphene.git
      cd graphene

#. Prepare a signing key::

      openssl genrsa -3 -out Pal/src/host/Linux-SGX/signer/enclave-key.pem 3072

#. Build Graphene and Graphene-SGX::

      sudo apt-get install -y \
         build-essential autoconf gawk bison wget python3 libcurl4-openssl-dev \
         python3-protobuf libprotobuf-c-dev protobuf-c-compiler python3-pip
      python3 -m pip install toml>=0.10
      make
      make ISGX_DRIVER_PATH="" SGX=1                  # this assumes Linux 5.11+
      meson build -Ddirect=enabled -Dsgx=enabled
      ninja -C build
      sudo ninja -C build install

#. Set ``vm.mmap_min_addr=0`` in the system (*only required for the legacy SGX
   driver and not needed for newer DCAP/in-kernel drivers*)::

      sudo sysctl vm.mmap_min_addr=0

   Note that this is an inadvisable configuration for production systems.

#. Build and run :program:`helloworld`::

      cd LibOS/shim/test/regression
      make SGX=1
      make SGX=1 sgx-tokens
      graphene-sgx helloworld

Running sample applications
---------------------------

We prepared and tested several applications to demonstrate Graphene and
Graphene-SGX usability. These applications can be found in the :file:`Examples`
folder in the repository, each containing a short README with instructions how
to test it. We recommend starting with simpler, thoroughly documented examples
like Memcached and Redis, to understand manifest options and features of
Graphene.
