Introduction to SGX
===================

Graphene project uses :term:`SGX` to securely run the software. SGX is a |nbsp|
complicated topic, which may be hard to learn, because the documentation is
scattered thorough official, reference documentation, blogposts and academic
papers. This page is an attempt to curate a |nbsp| dossier of available reading
material.

.. todo:: note about two SGX versions (SGX1 and SGX2)

Introduction-level

- `Overview of Intel SGX - Part 2, SGX Externals (Quarkslab)

Official Documentation
----------------------

- `IntelÂ® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual Volume 3D:
  System Programming Guide, Part 4
  <https://software.intel.com/en-us/download/intel-64-and-ia-32-architectures-sdm-volume-3d-system-programming-guide-part-4>`_
- `SDK for Linux <https://01.org/intel-software-guard-extensions/downloads>`_
  (download of both the binaries and the documentation)

Linux modules
-------------

At the time of this writing (December 2019) there are two modules in
circulation: one is distributed together with SDK (`github repo
<https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx-driver>`_) and another is being upstreamed
(`github repo <https://github.com/intel/SGXDataCenterAttestationPrimitives/tree/master/driver/linux>`_,
`LKML thread (v24) <https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20191129231326.18076-1-jarkko.sakkinen@linux.intel.com/>`_).

Those two are not to be confused. The driver from SDK is currently unversally
used, because it is the only driver mentioned in downloads, but is likely
a |nbsp| dead end, because it won't be ever upstreamed. The driver being
upstreamed supports only SGX2 and requires :term:`DCAP`.
