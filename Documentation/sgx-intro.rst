Introduction to SGX
===================

Graphene project uses :term:`SGX` to securely run software. SGX is
a |~| complicated topic, which may be hard to learn, because the documentation
is scattered thorough official, reference documentation, blogposts and academic
papers. This page is an attempt to curate a |~| dossier of available reading
material.

SGX is is an umbrella name of *technology* that is comprised from several parts:

- CPU/platform *hardware features*: the new instruction set, new
  microarchitecture with the :term:`PRM` (:term:`EPC`) memory region and some
  new MSRs and some new logic in the MMU and so on;
- the SGX :term:`Remote Attestation` *infrastructure*, online services provided
  by Intel and/or third parties (see :term:`DCAP`);
- :term:`SDK` and assorted *software*.

SGX is still being developed. The current (December 2019) version of CPU
features is referred to as "SGX1" or simply "SGX" and is more or less finalised.
All new/changed instructions from original SGX are informally referred to as
":term:`SGX2`".

Features which might be considered part of SGX2:

- :term:`EDMM` (Enclave Dynamic Memory Management) is part of SGX2
- :term:`FLC` (Flexible Launch Control), not strictly part of SGX2, but was not
  part of original SGX instruction either

As of now there is hardware support available for FLC but not SGX2 per se
(EDMM). Most of the literature available (especially introduction-level)
concerns original SGX1 only.

Linux kernel drivers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For historical reasons, there are three SGX drivers currently (March 2020):

- https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx-driver -- old one, does not support DCAP,
  deprecated

- https://github.com/intel/SGXDataCenterAttestationPrimitives/tree/master/driver
  -- new one, out-of-tree, supports both non-DCAP software infrastructure (with
  old EPID remote-attestation technique) and the new DCAP (with new ECDSA and
  more "normal" PKI infrastucture).

- Upstreaming in-kernel SGX driver (see LKML patches) -- will be upstreamed one
  day, supports both non-DCAP and DCAP. The DCAP driver closely matches this
  upstreaming version.

  The in-tree driver will not be a |~| module
  (https://lore.kernel.org/linux-sgx/20190401225717.GA13450@linux.intel.com/),
  so "installation instructions" will likely be minimal.

  Also it will not require :term:`IAS` and kernel maintainers consider
  non-writable :term:`FLC` MSRs as non-functional SGX:

SGX terminology

   like "Intel" and "SGX"

   Architectural Enclaves
   AE

      A |~| set of "system" enclaves concerned with starting other enclaves.

            Description of Remote Attestation

   Data Center Attestation Primitives
   DCAP

      A |~| software infrastructure provided by Intel as a reference
      implementation for the new ECDSA/:term:`PCS`-based remote attestation.
      Relies on the :term:`Flexible Launch Control` hardware feature. In
      principle this is a |~| special version of :term:`SDK`/:term:`PSW` that
      has a |~| reference launch enclave and is backed by the DCAP-enabled SGX
      driver.

      This allows for launching enclaves without Intel's remote infrastructure.
      But this requires deployment of own infrastructure, so is operationally
      more complicated. Therefore it is intended for server environments (where
      you control all the machines).

         Orientation Guide

         :term:`EPID`
            A |~| way to launch enclaves with Intel's infrastructure, intended
            for client machines.

   Enclave
      .. todo:: TBD

   Enclave Dynamic Memory Management
   EDMM
      A |~| hardware feature of :term:`SGX2`, allows dynamic memory allocation,
      which in turn allows dynamic thread creation.

   Enhanded Privacy Identification
   Enhanded Privacy Identifier
   EPID

      .. todo:: short description

      Contrary to DCAP, EPID may be understood as "opinionated", with most
      moving parts fixed and tied to services provided by Intel. This is
      intended for client enclaves and deprecated for server environments.

      .. seealso::

         :term:`DCAP`
            A way to launch enclaves without relying on the Intel's
            infrastructure.

   Flexible Launch Control
   FLC

      Hardware (CPU) feature that allows substituting :term:`Launch Enclave`.
      Basically, a |~| change in SGX's EINIT logic to not require the EINITTOKEN
      from the Intel-based Launch Enclave. An |~| MSR, which can be locked at
      boot time, keeps the hash of the public key of the "launching" entity,
      e.g., Microsoft would put its own public key into the FLC register and
      lock it at boot time.

      With FLC, :term:`Launch Enclave` can be written by other companies (other
      than Intel) and must be signed with the key corresponding to the one
      locked in the MSR (a |~| reference Launch Enclave simply allows all
      enclaves to run). Interestingly, the MSR can also stay unlocked and then
      it can be modified at run-time by the VMM or the OS kernel.

   Intel Attestation Service
   IAS

      Old Internet service provided by Intel for old :term:`EPID`-based remote
      attestation. Enclaves send SGX quotes to the client/verifier who will
      forward it to IAS to check its validity.

      .. seealso::

         :term:`PCS`
            Provisioning Certification Service, another Internet service

      Software infrastructure provided by Intel with all special
      :term:`Architectural Enclaves` (:term:`Provisioning Enclave`,
      :term:`Quoting Enclave`, :term:`Launch Enclave`). This mainly refers to
      the "old" EPID/IAS-based remote attestation.

   PCS

      New internet service provided by Intel for new ECDSA-based remote
      attestation. Enclave provider creates its own internal Attestation Service
      where it caches PKI collateral from Intel's PCS, and the verifier gets the
      certificate chain from the enclave provider to check validity.

   SDK

      In the context of :term:`SGX`, this means a |~| specific piece of software
      supplied by Intel which helps people write enclaves packed into ``.so``
      files to be accessible like normal libraries (at least on Linux).
      Available together with a |~| kernel module and documentation.

   SGX2

      This refers to "whatever Intel came up with after releasing original
      SGX1", usually with respect to hardware features and the instruction set
      in particular.

      There is no single definition, likely because this is still work in
      progress and Intel might . This encompasses at least :term:`EDMM`.

   Trusted Computing Base
   TCB

      In context of :term:`SGX` this has the usual meaning: the set of all
      components that are critical to security. Any vulnerability in TCB
      compromise security. Any problem outside TCB is not a |~| vulnerability,
      i.e. |~| should not compromise security.

      In context of Graphene there is a |~| different meaning (Thread Control
      Block). Those two should not be confused.
