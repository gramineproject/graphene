Introduction to SGX
===================

.. highlight:: sh

Graphene project uses :term:`SGX` to securely run software. SGX is
a |~| complicated topic, which may be hard to learn, because the documentation
is scattered through official/reference documentation, blogposts and academic
papers. This page is an attempt to curate a |~| dossier of available reading
material.

SGX is an umbrella name of *technology* that comprises several parts:

- CPU/platform *hardware features*: the new instruction set, new
  microarchitecture with the :term:`PRM` (:term:`EPC`) memory region and some
  new MSRs and some new logic in the MMU and so on;
- the SGX :term:`Remote Attestation` *infrastructure*, online services provided
  by Intel and/or third parties (see :term:`DCAP`);
- :term:`SDK` and assorted *software*.

SGX is still being developed. The current (March 2020) version of CPU features
is referred to as "SGX1" or simply "SGX" and is more or less finalized. All
new/changed instructions from original SGX are informally referred to as
":term:`SGX2`".

Features which might be considered part of SGX2:

- :term:`EDMM` (Enclave Dynamic Memory Management) is part of SGX2
- :term:`FLC` (Flexible Launch Control), not strictly part of SGX2, but was not
  part of original SGX hardware either

As of now there is hardware support (on a |~| limited set of CPUs) for FLC and
(on an even more limited set of CPUs) SGX2/EDMM. Most of the literature
available (especially introduction-level) concerns original SGX1 only.

Linux kernel drivers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For historical reasons, there are three SGX drivers currently (January 2021):

- https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx-driver -- old one, does not support DCAP,
  deprecated

- https://github.com/intel/SGXDataCenterAttestationPrimitives/tree/master/driver
  -- new one, out-of-tree, supports both non-DCAP software infrastructure (with
  old EPID remote-attestation technique) and the new DCAP (with new ECDSA and
  more "normal" PKI infrastructure).

- SGX support was upstreamed to the Linux mainline starting from 5.11.
  It currently supports only DCAP attestation. The driver is accessible through
  /dev/sgx_enclave and /dev/sgx_provision.

  The following udev rules are recommended for users to access the SGX node::

    groupadd -r sgx
    gpasswd -a USERNAME sgx
    groupadd -r sgx_prv
    gpasswd -a USERNAME sgx_prv
    cat > /etc/udev/rules.d/65-graphene-sgx.rules << EOF
      SUBSYSTEM=="misc",KERNEL=="sgx_enclave",MODE="0660",GROUP="sgx"
      SUBSYSTEM=="misc",KERNEL=="sgx_provision",MODE="0660",GROUP="sgx_prv"
      EOF
    udevadm trigger

  Also it will not require :term:`IAS` and kernel maintainers consider
  non-writable :term:`FLC` MSRs as non-functional SGX:

   Architectural Enclaves
   AE

      A |~| set of "system" enclaves concerned with starting and attesting other
      enclaves.

   Data Center Attestation Primitives
   DCAP

      A |~| software infrastructure provided by Intel as a reference
      implementation for the new ECDSA/:term:`PCS`-based remote attestation.
      Relies on the :term:`Flexible Launch Control` hardware feature. In
      principle this is a |~| special version of :term:`SDK`/:term:`PSW` that
      has a |~| reference launch enclave and is backed by the DCAP-enabled SGX
      driver.

      This allows for launching enclaves without Intel's remote infrastructure.
      But this requires deployment of own infrastructure, so is operationally
      more complicated. Therefore it is intended for server environments (where
      you control all the machines).

         Orientation Guide
            https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/dcap-1.0.1/docs/Intel_SGX_DCAP_ECDSA_Orientation.pdf

         :term:`EPID`
            A |~| way to launch enclaves with Intel's infrastructure, intended
            for client machines.

   Enclave
      .. todo:: TBD

   Enclave Dynamic Memory Management
   EDMM
      A |~| hardware feature of :term:`SGX2`, allows dynamic memory allocation,
      which in turn allows dynamic thread creation.

   EPC

      .. todo:: TBD

   Enhanced Privacy Identification
   Enhanced Privacy Identifier
   EPID

      .. todo:: short description

      Contrary to DCAP, EPID may be understood as "opinionated", with most
      moving parts fixed and tied to services provided by Intel. This is
      intended for client enclaves and deprecated for server environments.

      .. seealso::

         :term:`DCAP`
            A way to launch enclaves without relying on the Intel's
            infrastructure.

   Flexible Launch Control
   FLC

      Hardware (CPU) feature that allows substituting :term:`Launch Enclave` for
      one not signed by Intel. A |~| change in SGX's EINIT logic to not require
      the EINITTOKEN from the Intel-based Launch Enclave. An |~| MSR, which can
      be locked at boot time, keeps the hash of the public key of the
      "launching" entity.

      With FLC, :term:`Launch Enclave` can be written by other companies (other
      than Intel) and must be signed with the key corresponding to the one
      locked in the MSR (a |~| reference Launch Enclave simply allows all
      enclaves to run). The MSR can also stay unlocked and then it can be
      modified at run-time by the VMM or the OS kernel.

   Intel Attestation Service
   IAS

      Internet service provided by Intel for "old" :term:`EPID`-based remote
      attestation. Enclaves send SGX quotes to the client/verifier who will
      forward them to IAS to check their validity.

      .. seealso::

      Software infrastructure provided by Intel with all special
      :term:`Architectural Enclaves` (:term:`Provisioning Enclave`,
      :term:`Quoting Enclave`, :term:`Launch Enclave`). This mainly refers to
      the "old" EPID/IAS-based remote attestation.

   PCS

      New internet service provided by Intel for new ECDSA-based remote
      attestation. Enclave provider creates its own internal Attestation Service
      where it caches PKI collateral from Intel's PCS, and the verifier gets the
      certificate chain from the enclave provider to check validity.

      .. seealso::

         :term:`IAS`
            Intel Attestation Service, another Internet service.

      In the context of :term:`SGX`, this means a |~| specific piece of software
      supplied by Intel which helps people write enclaves packed into ``.so``
      files to be accessible like normal libraries (at least on Linux).
      Available together with a |~| kernel module and documentation.

   SGX2

      In context of :term:`SGX` this has the usual meaning: the set of all
      components that are critical to security. Any vulnerability in TCB
      compromises security. Any problem outside TCB is not a |~| vulnerability,
      i.e. |~| should not compromise security.

      In context of Graphene there is also a |~| different meaning
      (:term:`Thread Control Block`). Those two should not be confused.
