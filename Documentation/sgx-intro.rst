Introduction to SGX
===================

Graphene project uses :term:`SGX` to securely run software. SGX is
a |nbsp| complicated topic, which may be hard to learn, because the
documentation is scattered thorough official, reference documentation, blogposts
and academic papers. This page is an attempt to curate a |nbsp| dossier of
available reading material.

SGX is both an instruction set (a |nbsp| feature of the CPU) and accompanying
technology (:term:`SDK` and assorted libraries).

SGX is still being developed. The current (December 2019) version is referred to
as SGX1 and the next version is called SGX2. The distinguishing feature of SGX2
is :term:`EDMM` (Enclave Dynamic Memory Management). Another feature, which is
not strictly part of SGX2, but was not part of original SGX instruction
set is :term:`DCAP` (Data Center Attestation Primitives). As of now there is
hardware support available for DCAP but not SGX2 per se (EDMM).

Linux kernel modules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
At the time of this writing (December 2019) there are two modules in
circulation: one is distributed together with SDK (`github repo
<https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx-driver>`__) and another is being upstreamed
(`github repo <https://github.com/intel/SGXDataCenterAttestationPrimitives/tree/master/driver/linux>`__,
`LKML thread (v24) <https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20191129231326.18076-1-jarkko.sakkinen@linux.intel.com/>`__).

Those two are not to be confused. The driver from SDK is currently universally
used, because it is the only driver mentioned in downloads, but it won't be ever
upstreamed, so it is likely that it's days are numbered.

- The driver being upstreamed requires :term:`DCAP`.
- The SDK driver supports DCAP but does not require it.
- Linux will not merge anything that requires :term:`IAS` and maintainers
  consider non-writable :term:`FLC` MSRs as non-functional SGX:

            Description of Remote Attestation

   DCAP
      Data Center Attestation Primitives

      Also called Flexible Launch Control (FIXME is this accurate?). This allows
      for launching enclaves without Intel's remote infrastructure (FIXME only
      launch enclaves? does this also include local and remote attestation?).
      But this requires deployment of own infrastructure, so is operationally
      more complicated.

         :term:`DCAP`
            A way to launch enclaves without relying on the Intel's
            infrastructure.

   FLC
      Flexible Launch Control

      A |nbsp| way to substitute :term:`Launch Enclave` with another one, not
      supplied by Intel. This is done by overwriting MSR in BIOS.

   SDK

      In the context of :term:`SGX`, this means a |nbsp| specific piece of
      software supplied by Intel which helps people write enclaves packed into
      ``.so`` files to be accessible like normal libraries (at least on Linux).
      Available together with a |nbsp| kernel module and documentation.

   TCB
      Trusted Computing Base

      In context of :term:`SGX` this has the usual meaning: the set of all
      components that are critical to security. Any vulnerability in TCB
      compromise security. Any problem outside TCB is not a |nbsp|
      vulnerability, i.e. |nbsp| should not compromise security.

      In context of Graphene there is a |nbsp| particular meaning. Those two
      should not be confused.
