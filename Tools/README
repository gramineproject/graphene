Graphene-SGX Secure Container
--------------------------------
Graphene-SGX Secure Container (GSC) is a container system where the containerized application can be protected by Graphene-SGX while it is running in a container environment. The GSC system includes two parts: (1) a Docker container instance where the application is running inside Graphene-SGX and both of them are running inside the container instance; (2) a front-end named GSCE (GSC Engine) which takes a legacy Docker container image and automatically launches the contained application inside a GSC container instance.

Launching a GSC container instance includes following steps:

(1) Make sure there is a Docker container image of your application in the local or remote image repository.

(2) Download and Compile Graphene-SGX;

(2) Go to graphene/Tools

(3) Run a GSC container via the following command:

   ./gsce run [All the arguments used for launching a normal Docker container] [docker Image Name:Tag].

Let's take redis, a key-value, in-memory database as an example. Assume the user runs a normal redis from its docker image as follows.

docker run -i -t -p 6379:6379 redis:latest

To launch a GSC container running redis, simply change docker to "./gsce", i.e., the user runs the command as follows.

./gsce run -i -t -p 6379:6379 redis:latest

--------------------------------

Setting up the Dockerfile: 

If running a C++ for example your Dockerfile should have the following:
```docker
FROM gcc:9.1

# Ensure you add your path to the graphene folder
COPY . /home/username/graphene/LibOS/shim/test/apps/yourImageName 

WORKDIR /home/username/graphene/LibOS/shim/test/apps/yourImageName 

# You can use gcc or g++ and any flags you would like (std flag is for c++ 11 support)
RUN g++ -o app sourcefile.cpp -std=c++11 

CMD ["./app"]
```
Note: If GSC has issues finding your program and it is added under the trusted files, it is possible your path has a typo or is incorrect. 

--------------------------------

Issues You May Encounter
1) Graphene is having trouble handling the symbolic links in graphene/Runtime
	- For some reason graphene doesn't read symbolic links in certain instances. You will need to replace all of the links with a copy of the actual files with the same name to the Runtime folder. Rather than doing this manually (more painful than you may think) use this trick: 
	- `shopt -s globstar` <-- enables globstar option
	- `sed -i '' **/*` <-- replaces all of the links
2) Cannot find (generated_offsets)/(site).py 
	- Graphene for some reason can't access certain modules it needs to sign enclaves, so all you need to do is copy wherever the modules are located to the folder: `/home/username/graphene/Pal/src/host/Linux-SGX/signer`
3) "Cannot open device /dev/gsgx"
	- cd into `graphene/Pal/src/host/Linux-SGX/sgx-driver/load.sh`
	- run `./load.sh` to load the driver
4) Permission denied on mapping enclave
	- run `sudo sysctl vm.mmap_min_addr=0`
5) If there is an issue when running bash.manifest.sgx
	- edit the Entrypoint in relation to the executable in the Dockerfile
6) Issues with trusted files in GSC
	- Edit the gen_manifest python script and add your trusted files inside of the df.write. 
	- The names for the sgx trusted files are arbitrary but need to be unique or overlap issues will occur when signing the enclaves 
7) /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2: version 'SHIM' not found (required by libc.so.6)
    - This issue and its variations are usually related to incompatible gcc or g++ versions. Graphene might not support the latest release. Run `echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
8) "bad_alloc" or "st9_alloc" 
	- Your enclave size is too small (default is 256M). Try adding the line: `sgx.enclave_size = 1G` (Size must be a power of 2)
9) Cannot connect to AESMD service (socket cannot connect)
	- Most likley your isgx.ko did not load properly when you ran load.sh. Run load.sh and handle any errors that may appear (most are documented above)
