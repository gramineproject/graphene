A number of files taken from other C libraries:
* musl - MIT
* glibc - LGPL
 ** clone, sysdeps.h (and variants) used in code
 ** Pal/src/host/Linux/clone-x86_64.S
 ** LibOS/shim/include/elf.h
 ** LibOS/shim/src/elf/ - basically the whole directory, and most code related to linking and loading (e.g., Pal/src/db_rtld.c)
 ** Pal/include/elf/elf.h
 ** Pal/include/sysdeps/generic/ldsodefs.h
 ** Pal/include/sysdeps/generic/memcopy.h
 ** Pal/include/sysdeps/generic/sysdep.h
 ** Pal/lib/network/hton.c
 ** Pal/lib/string/ - the whole directory
 ** Pal/src/dynamic_link.h, do-rel.h , dl-machine-x86_64.h
 ** Pal/src/host/Linux/gettimeofday-x86_64.S
 ** Pal/src/host/Linux/include/ - whole directory - for signal API definitions
 ** We also build a patched glibc, but this could be moved into a separate repo

Some app and benchmark sources are redistributed under LibOS/shim/test/apps. These should probably be moved to subrepositories.
