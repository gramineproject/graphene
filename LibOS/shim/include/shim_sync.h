/*
 * Sync engine. The engine allows you to create *sync handles* with a global ID, and associated
 * data.
 *
 * A handle has to be locked before using, in one of two modes:
 *
 * - SYNC_STATE_SHARED: many processes can have a copy of the handle
 * - SYNC_STATE_EXCLUSIVE: only one process can have a copy of the handle, but the data stored
 *   handle can be updated
 *
 * When the handle is not locked, it can be downgraded to SYNC_STATE_INVALID by the remote
 * server. However, this will only happen if another process needs the handle. Therefore, as long as
 * the handle is uncontested, there is not communication overhead for using it.
 *
 * Example usage:
 *
 *     struct obj {
 *         int field;
 *         struct sync_handle sync;
 *     };
 *     struct obj obj = {0};
 *
 *     // Initialize the handle
 *     sync_open(&obj.sync, 0, sizeof(obj.field));
 *
 *     // Lock. Use SYNC_STATE_SHARED for reading data, SYNC_STATE_EXCLUSIVE if you need to update
 *     // it. After locking, you can read latest data.
 *     sync_lock(&obj.sync, SYNC_STATE_EXCLUSIVE);
 *     if (obj.sync.data_size == sizeof(obj.field))
 *         memcpy(&obj.field, obj.sync.buf, sizeof(obj.field);
 *
 *     // Use the object
 *     obj.field = ...;
 *
 *     // Unlock, writing the new data first
 *     obj.sync.data_size = sizeof(obj.field);
 *     memcpy(obj.sync.buf, &obj.field, sizeof(obj.field);
 *
 *     // Close the handle before destroying the object
 *     sync_close(&obj.sync);
 *
 * The sync engine is currently experimental. To enable it, set `libos.sync.enable = 1` in the
 * manifest. When it's not enabled, sync_lock() and sync_unlock() will function as regular, local
 * locks, and no remote communication will be performed.
 */

/*
 * TODO (necessary for correctness):
 * - server: delete client/handle info for unused handles
 * - server: delete client/handle info when a client disconnects
 * - client: flush all handles on process exit
 * - IPC: add a mechanism for self messages (from leader to itself) that does not use pipes
 *
 * TODO (new features for additional use cases):
 * - mechanism for independently acquiring the same handle, without knowing the ID (e.g. for a given
 *   file path)
 * - conditional acquire of a handle, perhaps similar to FUTEX_WAIT_BITSET: would allow for more
 *   fine-grained locking
