/*
 * Sync engine. The engine allows you to create *sync handles* with a global ID, and associated
 * data.
 *
 * A handle has to be locked before using, in one of two modes:
 *
 * - SYNC_STATE_SHARED: many processes can have a copy of the handle
 * - SYNC_STATE_EXCLUSIVE: only one process can have a copy of the handle, but the data stored
 *   with the handle can be updated
 *
 * When the handle is not locked, it can be downgraded to INVALID by the remote server. However,
 * this will only happen when another process needs to modify the same resource, and locks its own
 * handle in EXCLUSIVE mode (which means that data held by other processes are about to become
 * invalid). Therefore, as long as the handle is uncontested, there is not communication overhead
 * for using it.
 *
 * Example usage:
 *
 *     struct obj {
 *         int field_one;
 *         long field_two;
 *         struct sync_handle sync;
 *     };
 *     struct obj obj = {0};
 *
 *     struct obj_sync_data {
 *         int field_one;
 *         long field_two;
 *     };
 *
 *     // Initialize the handle
 *     sync_open(&obj.sync, 0, sizeof(struct obj_sync_data));
 *
 *     // Lock. Use SYNC_STATE_SHARED for reading data, SYNC_STATE_EXCLUSIVE if you need to update
 *     // it. After locking, you can read latest data (if it's there: a newly created handle will
 *     // not have any data associated).
 *     sync_lock(&obj.sync, SYNC_STATE_EXCLUSIVE);
 *     if (obj.sync.data_size != 0) {
 *         struct obj_sync_data* read_data = obj.sync.buf;
 *         assert(obj.sync.data_size == sizeof(*read_data));
 *         obj.field_one = read_data->field_one;
 *         obj.field_two = read_data->field_two;
 *     }
 *
 *     // Use the object
 *     obj.field = ...;
 *
 *     // Unlock, writing the new data first
 *     struct obj_sync_data* write_data = obj.sync.buf;
 *     obj.sync.data_size = sizeof(*write_data);
 *     assert(obj.sync.data_size <= obj.sync.buf_size);
 *     write_data->field_one = obj.field_one;
 *     write_data->field_two = obj.field_two;
 *     sync_unlock(&file->sync);
 *
 *     // Close the handle before destroying the object
 *     sync_close(&obj.sync);
 *
 * The sync engine is currently experimental. To enable it, set `libos.sync.enable = 1` in the
 * manifest. When it's not enabled, sync_lock() and sync_unlock() will function as regular, local
 * locks, and no remote communication will be performed.
 */

/*
 * Implementation overview:
 *
 * The sync engine uses a client/server architecture. The client code runs on all participating
 * processes, and the server code runs on the main process. The client and server communicate over
 * IPC.
 *
 * The client sends the following messages to server:
 *
 * - REQUEST_UPGRADE(id, state): The client requests access to a resource with given ID (in either
 *   SHARED or EXCLUSIVE) mode. The server will downgrade the handles for other clients (if that's
 *   necessary for fulfilling the request), and reply with UPGRADE once the resource can be used.
 *
 * - DOWNGRADE(id, state, data_size, data): The client confirms downgrade of its own handle, and
 *   sends the latest data associated with it. This is usually a response to REQUEST_DOWNGRADE.
 *
 * The server sends the following messages to the client:
 *
 * - UPGRADE(id, state, data_size, data): The server confirms upgrade of a handle to the client, and
 *   sends the last data associated with the handle. This is a response to REQUEST_UPGRADE.
 *
 * - REQUEST_DOWNGRADE(id, state, data_size, data): The server requests the client to downgrade its
 *   handle. The client will reply with DOWNGRADE when ready.
 *
 * Here is an example interaction:
 *
 *                                                        client1 state    client2 state
 *                                                        INVALID          INVALID
 *  1. client1 -> server: REQUEST_UPGRADE(123, SHARED)    .                .
 *  2. server -> client1: UPGRADE(123, SHARED)            SHARED           .
 *  3. client2 -> server: REQUEST_UPGRADE(123, SHARED)    |                .
 *  4. server -> client2: UPGRADE(123, SHARED)            |                SHARED
 *  5. client1 -> server: REQUEST_UPGRADE(123, EXCLUSIVE) |                |
 *  6. server -> client2: REQUEST_DOWNGRADE(123, INVALID) |                |
 *  7. client2 -> server: DOWNGRADE(123, INVALID)         |                INVALID
 *  8. server -> client1: UPGRADE(123, EXCLUSIVE)         EXCLUSIVE        .
 *
 * In the above diagram, both clients request resource 123 in SHARED mode, and they hold SHARED
 * handles at the same time. Later, when the first client requests EXCLUSIVE access, the other
 * client is asked to downgrade to INVALID before the upgrade can be confirmed.
 */

/*
 * TODO (necessary for correctness):
 * - server: delete client/handle info for unused handles
 * - server: delete client/handle info when a client disconnects
 * - client: flush all handles on process exit
 * - IPC: add a mechanism for self messages (from leader to itself) that does not use pipes
 *
 * TODO (new features for additional use cases):
 * - mechanism for independently acquiring the same handle, without knowing the ID (e.g. for a given
 *   file path)
 * - conditional acquire of a handle, perhaps similar to FUTEX_WAIT_BITSET: would allow for more
 *   fine-grained locking
