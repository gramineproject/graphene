/* This macro disables current vfork implementation and aliases it to fork.
 *
 * Rationale:
 * Current vfork() implementation is broken and works only in simple cases.
 * The implementation creates a new thread in the same process and runs it
 * in place of the previous (parent) thread which called vfork(). When the
 * "pseudo-process" new thread reaches execve(), it silently dies and
 * switches execution back to the suspended parent thread (as per vfork
 * semantics). Because execve() emulation creates a new host-OS process,
 * this vfork implementation works in simple benign cases.
 *
 * However, this co-existence of the "pseudo-process" thread with threads
 * of the parent process leads to bugs elsewhere in Graphene. In general,
 * the rest of Graphene is not aware of such situation when two processes
 * co-exist in the same Graphene instance and share memory. If the new
 * "pseudo-process" thread makes syscalls in-between vfork() and execve()
 * or abnormally dies or receives a signal, Graphene may hang or segfault
 * or end up with inconsistent internal state.
 *
 * Therefore, instead of trying to support Linux semantics for vfork() --
 * which requires adding corner-cases in signal handling and syscalls --
 * we simply redirect vfork() as fork(). We assume that performance hit is
 * negligible (Graphene has to migrate internal state anyway which is slow)
 * and apps do not rely on insane Linux-specific semantics of vfork().
