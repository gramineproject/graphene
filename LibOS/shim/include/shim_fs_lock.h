 * POSIX locks (also known as advisory record locks). See `man fcntl` for details.
 *
 * The current implementation works over IPC and handles all requests in the main process. It has
 * the following caveats:
 *
 * - Lock requests from other processes will always have the overhead of IPC round-trip, even if the
 *   lock is uncontested.
 * - The main process has to be able to look up the same file, so locking will not work for files in
 *   local-process-only filesystems (tmpfs).
 * - There is no deadlock detection (EDEADLK).
 * - The lock requests cannot be interrupted (EINTR).
 * - The locks work only on files that have a dentry (no pipes, sockets etc.)
