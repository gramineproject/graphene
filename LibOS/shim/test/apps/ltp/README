LTP FOR GRAPHENE
----------------

Running LTP test cases in Graphene :
1) run 'make' in LibOS/shim/test/apps/ltp 
2) cd Graphene/LibOS/shim/test/regression
3) make regression

The above command will start running LTP system call test cases in Graphene.

It works in 2 steps:
1) Creates a testfile (Graphene/LibOS/shim/test/apps/ltp/syscalls.graphene) with all the LTP system call test cases to run, excluding the ones mentioned in Graphene/LibOS/shim/test/apps/ltp/BLOCKED. “BLOCKED” contains all the test cases which are hanging in the Graphene and thus are excluded from regression tests.
2) Calls Graphene/LibOS/shim/test/apps/ltp/fetch.py It runs the LTP test cases and display output on the terminal. 
   Some LTP testcases hangs in Graphene. This python script sets a timeout for each testcase referring the file 'TIMEOUTS'. Default timeout is set 20 seconds in the script.
   It also shows, ‘new passed testcases’ (passed testcases which are not in Graphene/LibOS/shim/test/apps/ltp/PASSED) and ‘new failed testcases’ (failed testcases which are in ‘PASSED’). 
It also creates files ‘run_output’, ‘Failed.csv’, ‘Passed.csv’, ‘Blocked.csv’ under Graphene/LibOS/shim/test/apps/ltp for reference.
Results are of 4 types :
[Pass]   -> Testcase passed
[Failed] -> Testcase failed
[Hanged] -> Testcase hanged and thereafter killed
[Broken] -> Either system call is not implemented in Graphene or test preparation failed

To run one particular testcase, execute following :
 ~/Runtime/pal <ltp-repo>/opt/ltp/testcases/bin/<test>

In this way, one can debug one particular syscall testcase.

As you fix bugs, keep updating PASSED BLOCKED lists.
