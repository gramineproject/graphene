 * This function looks up a single dentry based on its parent dentry pointer

 *
 * This function checks the dcache first, and then, on a miss, falls back
 * to the low-level file system.
 *
 * The force flag causes the libOS to query the underlying file system for the
 * existence of the dentry, even on a dcache hit, whereas without force, a
 * negative dentry is treated as definitive.  A hit with a valid dentry is
 * _always_ treated as definitive, even if force is set.
