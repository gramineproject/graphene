# Node.js

This directory contains a Makefile and template manifest to run Node.js on
Graphene. This example uses Node.js installed on the system instead of compiling
from source as some of the other examples do.

# Quick Start

To run the regression test execute ```make check```. To do the same for SGX,
execute ```make SGX=1 check```.
