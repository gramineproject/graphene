# Cap'n Proto and Addressbook example

This directory contains the Makefile and the template manifest for the Addressbook example of the
Cap'n Proto protocol. Addressbook is the sample application that uses Cap'n Proto from the official
documentation (copied from the official GitHub repo, v0.7.0). We use the preinstalled libcapnp
library on the host OS instead of downloading the sources, building, and linking Addressbook against
the built library (which is possible but would require more effort). This was tested on machines
with SGX v1 and Ubuntu 16.04/18.04.

Please install the following prerequisites: `sudo apt install -y libcapnp-dev capnproto`.

# Quick Start

```sh
# build Addressbook and the final manifest
make SGX=1

# run original Addressbook
./addressbook write

# run Addressbook in non-SGX Graphene
./pal_loader addressbook write

# run Addressbook in Graphene-SGX
SGX=1 ./pal_loader addressbook write
```
