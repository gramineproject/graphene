# Bash example

This directory contains an example for running Bash in Graphene, including
the Makefile and a template for generating the manifest. The application is
tested on Ubuntu 16.04, with both normal Linux and SGX platforms.

# Generating the manifest

## Building for Linux

Run `make` (non-debug) or `make DEBUG=1` (debug) in the directory.

## Building for SGX

Run `make SGX=1` (non-debug) or `make SGX=1 DEBUG=1` (debug) in the directory.

# Running Bash with Graphene

Here's an example of running Bash scripts under Graphene:

Without SGX:
```
./pal_loader bash.manifest -c "ls"
./pal_loader bash.manifest -c "cd scripts && bash bash_test.sh 2"
```

With SGX:
```
SGX=1 ./pal_loader bash.manifest -c "ls"
SGX=1 ./pal_loader bash.manifest -c "cd scripts && bash bash_test.sh 2"
```
