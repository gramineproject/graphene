# Memcached

This directory contains the Makefile and the template manifest for the most
recent version of Memcached (as of this writing, commit 78eb770 on May 24,
2019). This was tested on a machine with SGX v1 and Ubuntu 16.04.

The Makefile and the template manifest contain extensive comments and are made
self-explanatory. Please review them to gain understanding in Graphene-SGX
and requirements for applications running under Graphene-SGX.

# Quick Start

```sh
# build Memcached and the final manifest
make SGX=1

# run original Memcached against a benchmark (memtier_benchmark,
# install the benchmark on your host OS first)
./memcached &
memtier_benchmark --port=11211 --protocol=memcache_binary --hide-histogram
killall memcached

# run Memcached in non-SGX Graphene against a benchmark
# (note -u nobody, for explanation see memcached.manifest.template)
./pal_loader memcached -u nobody &
memtier_benchmark --port=11211 --protocol=memcache_binary --hide-histogram
killall pal-Linux

# run Memcached in Graphene-SGX against a benchmark
SGX=1 ./pal_loader memcached -u nobody &
memtier_benchmark --port=11211 --protocol=memcache_binary --hide-histogram
killall pal-Linux-SGX
```
