# Memcached

This directory contains the Makefile and the template manifest for the most
recent version of Memcached as of this writing (v1.5.21). This was tested on a
machine with SGX v1 and Ubuntu 18.04.

The Makefile and the template manifest contain extensive comments and are made
self-explanatory. Please review them to gain understanding in Graphene-SGX
and requirements for applications running under Graphene-SGX.

# Prerequisites

Please install `libevent-dev` package. If you want to benchmark with memcslap,
also install `libmemcached-tools`.

# Quick Start

```sh
# build Memcached and the final manifest
make SGX=1

# run original Memcached against a benchmark (memtier_benchmark,
# install the benchmark on your host OS first)
./memcached &
memtier_benchmark --port=11211 --protocol=memcache_binary --hide-histogram
killall memcached

# run Memcached in non-SGX Graphene against a benchmark
# (note -u nobody, for explanation see memcached.manifest.template)
./pal_loader memcached -u nobody &
memtier_benchmark --port=11211 --protocol=memcache_binary --hide-histogram
killall pal-Linux

# run Memcached in Graphene-SGX against a benchmark
SGX=1 ./pal_loader memcached -u nobody &
memtier_benchmark --port=11211 --protocol=memcache_binary --hide-histogram
killall pal-Linux-SGX
```
