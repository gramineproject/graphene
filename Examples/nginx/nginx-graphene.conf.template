# This configuration file is based on nginx.conf.default from Nginx v1.16.1.
#
# The following changes are made:
# - Number of worker processes in increased from 1 to 4
# - Number of worker connections is decrease from 1024 to 768 (because Linux by default
#   limits FDs to 1024, and Graphene uses ~100 FDs for its own purposes, so we are left with
#   about 900 FDs available for Nginx application itself)
# - Listening port is changed from 80 to LISTEN_PORT
# - Listening host is changed from localhost to LISTEN_HOST
# - SSL/HTTPS with default params is enabled via LISTEN_SSL_PORT
# - Added `access_log off` to disable verbose log info (skewed perf results)
# - Added `daemon off` to run Nginx in the foreground

# Uncomment "user nobody;" below to switch to this user. If you run under root, use
# "user root;" instead. Typically there is no need to specify a non-default user.
