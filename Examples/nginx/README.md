# Nginx

This directory contains the Makefile and the template manifest for the most
recent version of Nginx web server (as of this writing, version 1.16.1).

We build Nginx from the source code instead of using an existing installation.
On Ubuntu 18.04, please make sure that the following packages are installed:
```sh
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential apache2-utils libssl-dev
```

NOTE: The "benchmark-http.sh" script uses the Apache Benchmark (ab) under the
hood. At least the default version of ab shipped with Ubuntu 18.04 (v2.3) does
not work correctly with Nginx and HTTPS (it fails on KeepAlive HTTPS requests).
We recommend to use the wrk benchmarking tool.

# Quick Start

```sh
# build Nginx and the final manifest
make SGX=1

# run original Nginx against HTTP and HTTPS benchmarks (benchmark-http.sh, uses ab)
./install/sbin/nginx -c conf/nginx-graphene.conf &
../common_tools/benchmark-http.sh 127.0.0.1:8002
../common_tools/benchmark-http.sh https://127.0.0.1:8444
kill -SIGINT %%

# run Nginx in non-SGX Graphene against HTTP and HTTPS benchmarks
graphene-direct ./nginx -c conf/nginx-graphene.conf &
../common_tools/benchmark-http.sh 127.0.0.1:8002
../common_tools/benchmark-http.sh https://127.0.0.1:8444
kill -SIGINT %%

# run Nginx in Graphene-SGX against HTTP and HTTPS benchmarks
graphene-sgx ./nginx -c conf/nginx-graphene.conf &
../common_tools/benchmark-http.sh 127.0.0.1:8002
../common_tools/benchmark-http.sh https://127.0.0.1:8444
kill -SIGINT %%

# you can also test the server using other utilities like wget
wget http://127.0.0.1:8002/random/10K.1.html
wget https://127.0.0.1:8444/random/10K.1.html
```

Alternatively, to run the Nginx server, use one of the following commands:

```
make start-native-server
make start-graphene-server
make SGX=1 start-graphene-server
```
