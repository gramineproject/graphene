# Redis

This directory contains the Makefile and the template manifest for the most
recent version of Redis (as of this writing, version 5.0.5). This was tested
on a machine with SGX v1 and Ubuntu 16.04.

The Makefile and the template manifest contain extensive comments and are made
self-explanatory. Please review them to gain understanding of Graphene-SGX
and requirements for applications running under Graphene-SGX.

# Quick Start

```sh
# build Redis and the final manifest
make SGX=1

# run original Redis against a benchmark (redis-benchmark supplied with Redis)
./redis-server --save '' --protected-mode no &
src/src/redis-benchmark
kill %%

# run Redis in non-SGX Graphene against a benchmark
./pal_loader redis-server --save '' --protected-mode no &
src/src/redis-benchmark
kill %%

# run Redis in Graphene-SGX against a benchmark
SGX=1 ./pal_loader redis-server --save '' --protected-mode no &
src/src/redis-benchmark
kill %%
```

# Why this Redis configuration?

Notice that we run Redis with two parameters: `save ''` and `protected-mode no`:

- `save ''` disables saving DB to disk (both RDB snapshots and AOF logs). We
  use this parameter to side-step some bugs in Graphene triggered during the
  graceful shutdown of Redis.

- `protected-mode no` allows clients to connect to Redis on any network
  interface. Even though we use the loopback interface (which is always allowed
  in Redis), Graphene hides this information. Therefore, we ask Redis to allow
  clients on all interfaces.

# Redis with Select

By default, Redis uses the epoll mechanism of Linux to monitor client connections.
To test Redis with select, add `USE_SELECT=1`, e.g., `make SGX=1 USE_SELECT=1`.
