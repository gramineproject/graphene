# Apache

This directory contains the Makefile and the template manifest for the most
recent version of Apache web server (as of this writing, version 2.4.41). This
was tested on a machine with SGX v1 and Ubuntu 16.04.

The Makefile and the template manifest contain extensive comments. Please review
them to understand the requirements for Apache running under Graphene-SGX.

We build Apache from the source code instead of using an existing installation.
On Ubuntu 16.04, please make sure that the following packages are installed:
```sh
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential flex libapr1-dev libaprutil1-dev libpcre2-dev \
                        apache2-utils libssl-dev
```

# Quick Start

```sh
# build Apache and the final manifest
make SGX=1

# run original Apache against HTTP and HTTPS benchmarks (benchmark-http.sh, uses ab)
make start-native-server &
./benchmark-http.sh 127.0.0.1:8001
./benchmark-http.sh https://127.0.0.1:8443
kill -SIGINT %%

# run Apache in non-SGX Graphene against HTTP and HTTPS benchmarks
make start-graphene-server &
./benchmark-http.sh 127.0.0.1:8001
./benchmark-http.sh https://127.0.0.1:8443
kill -SIGINT %%

# run Apache in Graphene-SGX against HTTP and HTTPS benchmarks
SGX=1 make start-graphene-server &
./benchmark-http.sh 127.0.0.1:8001
./benchmark-http.sh https://127.0.0.1:8443
kill -SIGINT %%

# you can also test the server using other utilities like wget
wget http://127.0.0.1:8001/random/10K.1.html
wget https://127.0.0.1:8443/random/10K.1.html
```

# Running Apache with Different MPMs

The Apache server can run with several different multi-processing modules
(MPMs). The two popular ones are *Prefork* and *Worker* MPMs. The Prefork
MPM uses multiple child processes with one thread each, and each process
handles one connection at a time. The Worker MPM uses multiple child processes
with many threads each, and each thread handles one connection at a time.

The supplied Makefile allows to run Apache in both configurations:
```sh
make start-native-server                  # run with Prefork MPM
make start-graphene-server                # run with Prefork MPM

make start-native-multithreaded-server    # run with Worker MPM
make start-graphene-multithreaded-server  # run with Worker MPM
```
