This directory contains auto-generated Protected Files, encrypted via pf_crypt.
In particular, it contains:

- `plain.txt` -- file to encrypt, contains "helloworld" string.
- `wrap-key` -- pre-generated wrap key "ffeeddccbbaa99887766554433221100"

Also, `input.txt` is generated by encoding `plain.txt` using `wrap-key` and it
contains the Graphene-format encoded "helloworld" string.
