SPEC GENERAL LICENSE AGREEMENT



Read the terms and conditions of this Agreement carefully before downloading or opening the package containing the SPEC 

product or any accompanying documentation (collectively, the "Materials").  Except where explicitly superseded by wording in 

the attached product license, this Agreement represents the entire Agreement between you and SPEC concerning the Materials 

and supersedes any prior proposal, representation or understanding between the parties.



Use and Re-Export of SPEC's software is subject to the United States Export Control Administration regulations. The software 

may not be used by unlicensed person or entities and may not be re-exported to another country. See Export Assurance (Clause 

12) of this license. 



The restrictions and limitations of this Agreement do not apply to those items contained in the Materials that have been 

modified under, or used under, licenses that require free redistribution. SPEC has collected copies or links to copies of all such 

items underneath the directory redistributable_sources, along with the licenses applicable to each item in that directory.



By downloading or opening this package containing "The Materials", you are accepting and agreeing to the terms of this 

Agreement. If you are not willing to be bound by these terms, you should promptly cease downloading "The Materials" or 

return the package to receive a refund of your money. 



COMPANY/NAME: 

MAIN SITE: 



1. Grant. SPEC agrees to grant and USER agrees to accept a nontransferable and nonexclusive license to use and modify the Materials, 

subject to the restrictions and conditions set forth below and in any accompanying product specific license. 



2. Copies and Location. USER may make only exact and complete copies of the original of the Materials. The original and copies 

thereof may be used only: 

*	By the user, if purchased by a non-corporate entity. This user must also abide by the Export Assurance (Clause 12) of this 

license. 

*	By anyone within the same corporate structure, if purchased by a corporation. Note that a "corporate user" must be identified 

and all technical support and contact with SPEC must be handled through that contact. This user and corporation must also 

abide by the Export Assurance (Clause 12) of this license. 



USER will not permit any third party to use or copy the original or any copy thereof. In the event of unauthorized transfer or copying, 

USER will pay SPEC a penalty in the amount of one additional fee for each such transfer or copy. 



3. Scope of Use. The Materials may be used only for the generation of data regarding measurement and analysis of computer system 

(hardware and software) performance and/or power usage on those Materials. Modification or merger with other software is allowed 

only as specified in the Run and Reporting Rules for the given SPEC benchmark or tool product. USER may not distribute the 

Materials or any modification to the Materials with the following exceptions: 



*	USER may distribute those items specifically included in the directory of redistributable sources according to the 

terms of their open source licenses. 

*	USER may share only with other SPEC licensees of this product modifications created by USER for purposes of 

performance and/or power usage analysis. Such modifications shall be limited to 1) modifying the code to instrument 

the product; or 2) modifying the workload to enable further analysis on systems under the USER's control or 3) a 

combination of 1) and 2). 







In addition to the terms, if you purchased SERT, the following specific terms apply: 



*	You may NOT use the Materials under contract to produce data for another entity unless that entity also has a license to the 

Materials.

*	You must adhere to the required Run and Reporting Rules located at http://www.spec.org/sert2/SERT-runrules.pdf.



For performance or power measurement results obtained from such modified product, USER may not 1) represent the results as being 

compliant results of the product or 2) use official SPEC metric name(s) to identify the results. 



The Materials may include executable code for the SPEC Power and Temperature Daemon (SPEC PTDaemon). The SPEC PTDaemon 

is licensed for use only with the Materials or modifications of the Materials as described herein. It is NOT licensed for use as a 

standalone tool or for integration into a tool that is unrelated to the Materials.

 

4. Fee. The fee paid by the USER to SPEC for the Materials is in consideration of SPEC's cost in connection with the production and 

distribution of the Materials and is not a royalty. 



5. Reports. In order to preserve the integrity of SPEC's performance standards, USER agrees to run the Materials in accordance with 

the benchmark product rules published by SPEC for the Materials. If the USER chooses to publicly report measured results, the 

reporting must be strictly in accordance with the SPEC product rules, including the SPEC Fair Use Rule. 



The SPEC Fair Use Rule is posted at www.spec.org/fairuse.html. SPEC product rules are posted at www.spec.org in the documentation 

pages for each SPEC product. Both the Fair Use rule and the SPEC product rules may be updated from time to time. USERS are 

required to comply with the posted versions of the rules, including all updates. If substantive changes are made to the rules as solely 

determined by SPEC, a notice will be posted at SPEC's top-level page, www.spec.org, to define a transition period during which 

compliance shall be phased in. 



SPEC practices associated with perceived violations of Fair Use or other license terms can be found at:   

	http://www.spec.org/spec/docs/penaltiesremedies.pdf. 



In addition to the terms, you agree to comply with the following requirements for public use of information generated by the Materials:



*	Competitive comparisons that promote the use of one product over another and use numeric data generated by the SERT Suite 

2.x are expressly disallowed.

*	The only information provided by the SERT Suite 2.x that can be used for marketing collateral is the qualification of a server 

configuration or server family for an energy efficiency regulatory program.

*	The only information provided by the SERT Suite 2.x  that can be used for public comparison when removed from the context 

of the full Power and Performance Datasheet is the ENERGY STAR qualification of a server configuration or server family, 

or a similar qualification defined by another regulatory agency. All other publicly available information is provided in the 

datasheet and references must be made to this document in its entirety.

*	If the tool is used for research to generate information outside of energy efficiency regulatory programs, the information may 

not be compared to the results that are associated with an official energy efficiency regulatory program, and competitive 

comparisons may not be made using the data generated.



6. Term. This Agreement is effective upon USER opening the package containing the Materials or upon downloading the Materials 

from an electronic distribution source and shall continue until terminated. USER may terminate the Agreement at any time by providing 

written notification to SPEC that all copies have been destroyed, but the provisions of Sections 5, 7, 8 and 10 shall survive any 

termination. 



The license granted as to the current release of the Materials shall terminate when SPEC issues and makes available to the USER a 

subsequent release of such materials. 



In the event of a breach by the USER of any provision hereof, SPEC may terminate this , and the licenses granted hereunder, in whole 

or as to any portion of the Materials upon 30 days written notice unless the default is cured within such 30-day period. Upon 

termination of the license, USER shall immediately destroy all copies of the Materials and shall provide written notification to SPEC 

that all copies have been destroyed. 



7. Use of Name. It is acknowledged that all trademark and trade name rights in the names are owned exclusively by SPEC and such 

ownership shall be acknowledged in any use of the name by the USER (i.e. - noting that these are "trademarks of the Standard 

Performance Evaluation Corporation"). 



8. Ownership of Material: This Agreement does not constitute a sale of the Materials but is only a license to use in accordance with 

the terms of this Agreement. USER acknowledges that title, ownership and all intellectual property rights in and to the Materials and 

any copies are owned by and remain with SPEC.



9. Indemnity. USER agrees to indemnify and hold SPEC harmless from any claims, expenses, or liabilities caused by USER's use of 

the Materials or by USER's publication or use of data arising from its use of the Materials. 



Disclaimer of Warranties. SPEC MAKES NO WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, RELATING TO 

THE SALE, USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE MATERIALS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY 

WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR USE OR PURPOSE, AND ALL SUCH 

WARRANTIES ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED AND EXCLUDED BY SPEC. 



USER RECOGNIZES THAT THE PRODUCTS ARE THE RESULT OF A COOPERATIVE, NON- PROFIT EFFORT AND 

THAT SPEC DOES NOT CONDUCT A TYPICAL BUSINESS. USER ACCEPTS THE MATERIALS "AS IS" AND 

WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. HOWEVER, IF ANY MEDIA DEFECT IS FOUND IN THE 

MATERIALS WITHIN NINETY (90) DAYS AFTER SHIPMENT TO THE USER, SPEC SHALL REPLACE THE MEDIA 

WITH A COPY WITHOUT MEDIA DEFECT, WHICH SHALL BE USER'S SOLE REMEDY. 



10. Limitation of Liability. SPEC assumes no liability with respect to the Materials, including liability for infringement of intellectual 

property rights, negligence, or any other liability. 



SPEC is not aware of any infringement of copyright or patent that may result from its transfer to USER of the Materials. If USER 

receives any notice of infringement, such notice shall be immediately communicated to SPEC who will take immediate action to 

evaluate the claim and, if practicable, modify the Materials as necessary to avoid infringement. USER waives any claim against SPEC 

in the event of such infringement. 



SPEC's total liability for any reason shall not exceed the amount of the fee paid to SPEC. In no event will SPEC be liable for any 

indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, including the sale, use or 

performance of the Materials, even if SPEC shall have knowledge of the possibility of such damages. 



11. Maintenance and Support. SPEC has no obligation to provide support, maintenance, updates, modifications or new releases of the 

Materials to USER under this Agreement. 



12. Export Assurance. Use and re-export of SPEC's software and related technical information is subject to the Export Administration 

Regulations (EAR) of the United States Department of Commerce. USER hereby agrees that USER (a) assumes responsibility for 

compliance with the EAR in its use of the software and technical information, and (b) will not export, re-export, or otherwise disclose 

directly or indirectly, the software, technical data, or any direct product of the software or technical data in violation of the EAR. 



13. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be construed and governed in accordance with the laws of the State of California. If any 

term of this Agreement is declared void or not enforceable by any competent court of jurisdiction, all other terms shall remain in effect. 



14. No Waiver. The failure of either party to enforce any term herein or to take action in the event of any violation of these terms shall 

not be deemed a waiver by that party as to the subsequent enforcement of any rights.
