# Python example

This directory contains an example for running Python 3 in Graphene, including
the Makefile and a template for generating the manifest. The application is
tested on Ubuntu 16.04 and Ubuntu 18.04, with both normal Linux and SGX
platforms. The tested versions of Python are 3.5 and 3.6.

# Generating the manifest

## Installing prerequisites

For generating the manifest and running the test scripts, please run the following
command to install the required utility packages (Ubuntu-specific):

    sudo apt-get install libnss-mdns

## Building for Linux

Run `make` (non-debug) or `make DEBUG=1` (debug) in the directory.

## Building for SGX

Run `make SGX=1` (non-debug) or `make SGX=1 DEBUG=1` (debug) in the directory.

## Building with a local Python installation

By default, the `make` command creates the manifest for the Python binary from
the system installation. If you have a local installation, you may create the
manifest with the `PYTHONPATH` variable set accordingly. You can also specify
a particular version of Python. For example:

```
make PYTHONPATH=<python install path> PYTHONVERSION=python3.6 SGX=1
```

By default, `PYTHONPATH=/usr` and `PYTHONVERSION=python3.5`.


# Run Python with Graphene

Here's an example of running Python scripts under Graphene:

Without SGX:
```
./pal_loader python.manifest scripts/helloworld.py
./pal_loader python.manifest scripts/fibonacci.py
```

With SGX:
```
SGX=1 ./pal_loader python.manifest scripts/helloworld.py
SGX=1 ./pal_loader python.manifest scripts/fibonacci.py
```

You can also manually run included tests:
```
SGX=1 ./run-tests.sh
```
