# Lighttpd Example

This directory contains an example for running lighttpd in Graphene, including the Makefile and a
template for generating the manifest. We tested lighttpd on Ubuntu 16.04.

# Building lighttpd source

For this example, we build lighttpd from source instead of using an existing binary. To build
lighttpd on Ubuntu 16.04, please make sure that the following packages are installed:

    sudo apt-get install -y build-essential apache2-utils

## Linux

Run `make` (non-debug) or `make DEBUG=1` (debug) in the directory.

## SGX

Run `make SGX=1` (non-debug) or `make SGX=1 DEBUG=1` (debug) in the directory to prepare lighttpd to
run on SGX.

# Running lighttpd natively, under Graphene, and under Graphene-SGX

Execute one of the following commands to start lighttpd either natively (non-Graphene), on Graphene
or Graphene-SGX, respectively.

    make start-native-server
    make start-graphene-server
    SGX=1 make start-graphene-server

Because these commands will start the lighttpd server in the foreground, you will need to open
another console to run the client.

Once the server has started, you can test it with `wget`

    wget http://127.0.0.1:8003/random/10K.1.html

You may also run the benchmark script using `ab` (Apachebench)

    ./benchmark-http.sh 127.0.0.1:8003

Use Ctrl-C to terminate the server once you are finished testing lighttpd.

# Clean up

There are two commands to clean up the directory:

* `make clean`: Remove manifest, signature, and token files.
* `make distclean`: Remove the lighttpd source code and installation directory.
