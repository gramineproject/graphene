# SGX general options

# Set the virtual memory size of the SGX enclave. For SGX v1, the enclave
# size must be specified during signing. If lighttpd needs more virtual memory
# than the enclave size, Graphene will not be able to allocate it.
sgx.enclave_size = 256M

# Set the maximum number of enclave threads. For SGX v1, the number of enclave
# TCSes must be specified during signing, so the application cannot use more
# threads than the number of TCSes. Note that Graphene also creates an internal
# thread for handling inter-process communication (IPC), and potentially another
# thread for asynchronous events. Therefore, the actual number of threads that
# the application can create is (sgx.thread_num - 2).
