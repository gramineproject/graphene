/*
 * TODO: (GDB 8.2)
 *
 * To add the files in GDB, we use the 'add-symbol-file' command. In the GDB versions we support,
 * that command requires specifying a text section address (and, apparently, all the other
 * sections). In GDB 8.2, the 'text_addr' parameter is optional, and there is a new '-o offset'
 * option which allows to just specify load address for the whole file, and that's enough to load
 * all the sections.
 *
 * Once we are able to rely on newer GDB, we can get rid the section list (struct debug_section).
 * It's also possible that we will be able to use the r_debug structure instead, so that the same
 * mechanism is
 * used in Linux and Linux-SGX (even though in Linux-SGX we parse the structure manually in Python).
