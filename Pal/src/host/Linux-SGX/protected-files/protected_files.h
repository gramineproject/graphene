/* Protected files (PF) are a new type of file that can be specified in the manifest (SGX only).
 * They are encrypted on disk and transparently decrypted when accessed by Graphene or by
 * application running inside Graphene.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Data is encrypted (confidentiality) and integrity protected (tamper resistance).
 * - File swap protection (a PF can only be accessed when in a specific path).
 * - Transparency (Graphene application sees PFs as regular files, no need to modify
 *   the application).
 *
 * Internal PF format is based on the SGX SDK implementation:
 * https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx/tree/master/sdk/protected_fs
 *
 * Note: Graphene PFs can't be read by the SGX SDK (nor the other way around) due to some
 *       differences in internal structures.
