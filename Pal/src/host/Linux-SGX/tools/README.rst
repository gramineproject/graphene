RA-TLS Libraries
----------------

RA-TLS integrates Intel SGX remote attestation into the TLS connection setup. Conceptually, it
extends the standard X.509 certificate with SGX-related information. The additional information
allows the receiver (verifier) of the certificate to verify that it is indeed communicating with
an SGX enclave (attester). RA-TLS is shipped as three libraries: ``ra_tls_attest.so``, EPID-based
``ra_tls_verify_epid.so`` and ECDSA-based (DCAP) ``ra_tls_verify_dcap.so``.

``ra_tls_attest.so``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This library creates the self-signed RA-TLS certificate. It must be loaded into the SGX enclave.
This library relies on the pseudo-FS ``/dev/attestation`` to retrieve the SGX quote and embed it
into the RA-TLS certificate. Typically linked into server applications. Not thread-safe.

The library expects the following information in the manifest for EPID-based attestation:

- ``sgx.remote_attestation = 1`` -- remote attestation is enabled.
- ``sgx.ra_client_spid`` -- client SPID for EPID remote attestation.
- ``sgx.ra_client_linkable`` -- client linkable/unlinkable attestation policy.

For ECDSA-based (DCAP) attestation, the library expects instead:

- ``sgx.remote_attestation = 1`` -- remote attestation is enabled.
- ``sgx.ra_client_spid = "<empty string>"`` -- it is DCAP attestation, *not* EPID attestation.

The library uses the following environment variables if available:

- ``RA_TLS_CERT_TIMESTAMP_NOT_BEFORE`` -- the generated RA-TLS certificate uses this
  timestamp-not-before value, in the format "20010101000000" (this is also the default value if
  environment variable is not available).
- ``RA_TLS_CERT_TIMESTAMP_NOT_AFTER`` -- the generated RA-TLS certificate uses this
  timestamp-not-after value, in the format "20301231235959" (this is also the default value if
  environment variable is not available).

``ra_tls_verify_epid.so``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This library contains the verification callback that should be registered with the TLS library
during verification of the TLS certificate. It verifies the RA-TLS certificate and the SGX quote by
sending it to the Intel Attestation Service (IAS) and retrieving the attestation report from IAS.
Typically linked into client applications. Not thread-safe.

The library uses the following SGX-specific environment variables, representing SGX measurements,
if available:

- ``RA_TLS_MRSIGNER`` (optional) -- verify that the server enclave has this ``MRSIGNER``. This is a
  hex string.
- ``RA_TLS_MRENCLAVE`` (optional) -- verify that the server enclave has this ``MRENCLAVE``. This is
  a hex string.
- ``RA_TLS_ISV_PROD_ID`` (optional) -- verify that the server enclave has this ``ISV_PROD_ID``.
  This is a decimal string.
- ``RA_TLS_ISV_SVN`` (optional) -- verify that the server enclave has this ``ISV_SVN``. This is a
  decimal string.

The four SGX measurements above may be also verified via a user-specified callback with the
signature ``int (*callback)(char* mrenclave, char* mrsigner, char* isv_prod_id, char* isv_svn)``.
This callback must be registered via ``ra_tls_set_measurement_callback()``. The measurements from
the received SGX quote are passed as four arguments. It is up to the user to implement the correct
verification of SGX measurements in this callback (e.g., by comparing against expected values stored
in a central database).

The library also uses the following SGX-specific environment variable:

- ``RA_TLS_ALLOW_OUTDATED_TCB_INSECURE`` (optional) -- whether to allow outdated TCB as returned in
  the IAS attestation report or returned by the DCAP verification library. Values ``1/true/TRUE``
  mean "allow outdated TCB". Note that allowing outdated TCB is **insecure** and should be used
  only for debugging and testing. Outdated TCB is not allowed by default.

The library uses the following EPID-specific environment variables if available:

- ``RA_TLS_EPID_API_KEY`` (mandatory) -- client API key for EPID remote attestation.
- ``RA_TLS_IAS_REPORT_URL`` (optional) -- URL for IAS "verify attestation evidence" API endpoint.
  If not specified, the default hard-coded URL for IAS is used.
- ``RA_TLS_IAS_SIGRL_URL`` (optional) -- URL for IAS "Retrieve SigRL" API endpoint. If not
  specified, the default hard-coded URL for IAS is used.
- ``RA_TLS_IAS_PUB_KEY_PEM`` (optional) -- public key of IAS. If not specified, the default
  hard-coded public key is used.

``ra_tls_verify_dcap.so``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Similarly to ``ra_tls_verify_epid.so``, this library contains the verification callback that
should be registered with the TLS library during verification of the TLS certificate. Verifies
the RA-TLS certificate and the SGX quote by forwarding it to DCAP verification library
(``libsgx_dcap_quoteverify.so``) and checking the result. Typically linked into client
applications. Not thread-safe.

The library uses the same SGX-specific environment variables as ``ra_tls_verify_epid.so`` and
ignores the EPID-specific environment variables. Similarly to the EPID version, instead of using
environment variables, the four SGX measurements may be verified via a user-specified callback
registered via ``ra_tls_set_measurement_callback()``.

The library expects all the DCAP infrastructure to be installed and working correctly on the host.


Secret Provisioning Libraries
-----------------------------

Secret Provisioning libraries are reference implementations for the flows to provision secrets from
a trusted machine (server, verifier) to an enclavized application (client, attester). These
libraries rely heavily on RA-TLS and re-use the same configuration parameters as listed above.

Conceptually, a client application and a trusted server establish a secure RA-TLS communication
channel via TLS mutual attestation. The server sends its normal X.509 certificate for verification
by client, whereas the client sends its RA-TLS X.509 certificate with SGX-related information for
verification by server. After this mutual attestation, the trust is established, and the server
provisions the secrets to the client. The established TLS channel may be either closed after
provisioning these initial secrets or may be further used by both parties for continued secure
communication.

Secret Provisioning is shipped as three libraries: ``secret_prov_attest.so``, EPID-based
``secret_prov_verify_epid.so`` and ECDSA-based (DCAP) ``secret_prov_verify_dcap.so``.

``secret_prov_attest.so``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This library is typically linked into client (enclavized) applications. The application calls into
this library to initiate the RA-TLS session with the remote trusted server for secret provisioning.
Alternatively, the library runs before application's entry point, initializes the RA-TLS session,
receives the secret and stashes it in an environment variable ``SECRET_PROVISION_SECRET_STRING``.
In both cases, the application may call into the library to continue secure communication with the
trusted server and/or to retrieve the secret. This library is not thread-safe.

The library expects the same configuration information in the manifest and environment variables as
RA-TLS. In addition, the library uses the following environment variables if available:

- ``SECRET_PROVISION_CONSTRUCTOR`` (optional) -- set it to ``1/true/TRUE`` to initialize the
  RA-TLS session and retrieve the secret before the application starts. By default, it is not set,
  thus secret provisioning must be explicitly requested by the application.

- ``SECRET_PROVISION_SET_PF_KEY`` (optional) -- set it to ``1/true/TRUE`` to indicate that the
  provisioned secret is a protected-files master key. The key must be a 32-char null-terminated
  AES-GCM encryption key in hex format, similar to ``sgx.protected_files_key`` manifest option.
  This environment variable is checked only if ``SECRET_PROVISION_CONSTRUCTOR`` is set.

- ``SECRET_PROVISION_SERVERS`` (optional) -- a comma, semicolon or space separated list of server
  names with ports to connect to for secret provisioning. Example:
  ``localhost:4433;trusted-server:443``. If not set, defaults to ``localhost:4433``.
  Alternatively, the application can specify it as an argument of ``secret_provision_start()``.

- ``SECRET_PROVISION_CA_CHAIN_PATH`` (required) -- a path to the CA chain of certificates to verify
  the server. Alternatively, the application can specify it as an argument of
  ``secret_provision_start()``.

The secret may be retrieved by the application in two ways:

- Reading ``SECRET_PROVISION_SECRET_STRING`` environment variable. It is updated only if
  ``SECRET_PROVISION_CONSTRUCTOR`` is set to true and if the secret is representable as a string of
  maximum 4K characters.
- Calling ``secret_provision_get()`` function. It always updates its pointer argument to the secret
  (or ``NULL`` if secret provisioning failed).

``secret_prov_verify_epid.so``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This library is typically linked into a (normal non-enclavized) secret-provisioning server service.
The server calls into this library to listen for clients in an endless loop. When a new client
connects, the server initiates an RA-TLS session with the client, verifies the RA-TLS X.509
certificate of the client, and provisions the secret to the client if verification is successful.
The server can register a callback to continue secure communication with the client (instead of
simply closing the session after the first secret is sent to the client).  This library is not
thread-safe. This library uses EPID-based RA-TLS flows underneath.

The library expects the same configuration information in the manifest and environment variables as
RA-TLS.

``secret_prov_verify_dcap.so``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Similarly to ``secret_prov_verify_epid.so``, this library is used in secret-provisioning servers.
The only difference is that this library uses ECDSA/DCAP-based RA-TLS flows underneath.

The library uses the same SGX-specific environment variables as ``secret_prov_verify_epid.so`` and
ignores the EPID-specific environment variables. The library expects all the DCAP infrastructure
to be installed and working correctly on the host.
