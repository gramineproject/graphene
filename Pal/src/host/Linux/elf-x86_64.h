       and compare it with the current value that we can get via
       an RIP relative addressing mode.  Note that this is the address
       of _dl_start before any relocation performed at runtime.  In case
       the binary is prelinked the resulting "address" is actually a
       load offset which is zero if the binary was loaded at the address
